# waiting-time
This provides the core datafiles and replication code for Holt and Vinopal's analysis of waiting time using the 2003-2019 ATUS. The data files needed for the replication are atusact0319.dta, atusrost0319.dta, atussum0319.dta, atuscps0319.dta, and atusresp0319.dta. The do file that replicates the tables and figures in the analysis from the raw data is waiting_replication.do. Simply replace the directory at the beginning of the do file with the path to the locally store datafiles after downloading them and execute the do file. Please report any errors or issues to sbh.steveholt@gmail.com.
