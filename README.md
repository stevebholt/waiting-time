# waiting-time
This provides replication code for Holt and Vinopal's analysis of waiting time using the 2003-2019 ATUS. The data files needed for the replication are atusact0319.dta, atusrost0319.dta, atussum0319.dta, atuscps0319.dta, and atusresp0319.dta. Download from the ATUS website (here: https://www.bls.gov/tus/datafiles-0319.htm) and rename the files to match their names in this README for the do file to run successfully. The do file that replicates the tables and figures in the analysis from the raw data is waiting_replication.do. Simply replace the directory at the beginning of the do file with the path to the locally store datafiles after downloading them and execute the do file. Please report any errors or issues to sbh.steveholt@gmail.com. The cleaned data can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5z2pornijzv0bn8/AAABc-y5Rx8u8O7SRccTqtsda?dl=0.
