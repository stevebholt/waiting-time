# waiting-time
This provides replication code for Holt and Vinopal's analysis of waiting time using the 2003-2019 ATUS. The data files needed for the replication are atusact0319.dta, atusrost0319.dta, atussum0319.dta, atuscps0319.dta, and atusresp0319.dta. Download from the ATUS website (here: https://www.bls.gov/tus/datafiles-0319.htm) and rename the files to match their names in this README for the do file to run successfully. The do files replicate the analysis in the version of the paper accepted at Nature Human Behaviour and run in order. Simply replace the directory at the beginning of the do file named "01_master" with the path to the locally stored datafiles after downloading them, ensure there is a subdirectory named "logs" and a subdirectory named "output" and execute the do file. Please report any errors or issues to sbh.steveholt@gmail.com. The cleaned data can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5z2pornijzv0bn8/AAABc-y5Rx8u8O7SRccTqtsda?dl=0.
